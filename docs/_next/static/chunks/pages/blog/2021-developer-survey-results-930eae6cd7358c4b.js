very seriously.\nHere&#39;s what we&#39;ve learned about your needs after poring over the results.</p>\n<p>As with the previous iterations, the survey was divided into three sections: <a href="#your-needs">&quot;Your needs&quot;</a>, <a href="#your-product">&quot;Your product&quot;</a>, and <a href="#about-you">&quot;About you&quot;</a>.</p>\n<h2 id="your-needs">Your needs<a

disappointed&quot;). That&#39;s in keeping with 94% of you who felt the same way when we asked this question in 2019 and 2020.</p>\n<img src="/static/blog/2021-developer-survey-results/1.png" style="width: 796px; margin-top: 16px; margin-bottom: 8px;" alt="Bar chart: 62.7% Very disappointed, 30.4% Somewhat disappointed, 6.9% Not disappointed." />\n\n<p class="blog-description">1567\xa0out of 1589 answered.</p>\n\n<p>Notably, 2021 saw a 10% loss in the &quot;Very disappointed&quot; category, and a comparable gain in those who would only be &quot;Somewhat disappointed.&quot; This suggests that some of you may be less enthusiastic about MUI&#39;s products when compared with previous years, and that&#39;s something we need to evaluate moving forward.</p>\n<p>Those who would be &quot;Not disappointed&quot;—a group that grew by 1%—were asked to explain why. Here&#39;s what they said:</p>\n<p><strong>The number of available alternatives</strong></p>\n<p>Lately, with each new day a new UI component library appears.\nBecause they aim to solve the same problems, these libraries often arrive at solutions that are very similar to one another.\nThe establishment of common industry-wide patterns makes it that much more difficult to stand out from the crowd.\nMeanwhile, we&#39;re working hard to expand beyond our core products to provide you with experiences that other libraries can&#39;t match.</p>\n<p><strong>The introduction of a paid product</strong></p>\n<p>A big challenge with open-source is that maintainers capture very little value.\nThe MIT licensed model has enabled the growth of a large community of contributors as well as the MUI team itself, but it does have its limitations.\nTo push the products as forward as we believe it&#39;s possible, we needed a way to invest more in them.\n<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-core_model">Open-core</a> allows us to still offer an MIT licensed (free) version of the MUI X components while charging for additional features that require more attention (including support).</p>\n<p>It&#39;s still early days for MUI X, though.\nWe introduced it at the end of 2020 and have been iterating not only on the components but on the model itself.</p>\n<p>We still have a lot more ground to cover — only ~0.1% of our developer community has been convinced to upgrade to the paid Pro plan so far.\nWhether or not you&#39;ve taken the plunge, we&#39;d love to hear your thoughts about this.\nAnd if you want to understand more about our view of the open-source/commercial balance, check our <a href="https://mui-org.notion.site/Stewardship-542a2226043d4f4a96dfb429d16cf5bd">Stewardship page</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>The breaking changes made in v5</strong></p>\n<p>Our most recent release, MUI Core v5, introduced some important breaking changes.\nThe main problem we wanted to tackle was customizability: unlocking more styling options without compromising on performance.</p>\n<p>This new styling solution still has a ways to go in terms of maturity, and there&#39;s no denying that it requires a considerable amount of work to migrate from v4.\nFor our part, we still have a lot of work to do to help you make the most of the new features in v5, and we welcome your feedback.</p>\n<p>What can we do to help you succeed?

This is an interesting one because it&#39;s not an issue that we specifically addressed.\nCould this just be a result of the growing pressure in the market to build faster? Or because we somehow made this value proposition more noticeable? It could also be related to the next item.</li>\n<li><strong>Developer experience (1.1x):</strong><ul>\n<li>Consistency (1.75x): We didn&#39;t work on this dimension, and yet it grew.\nIt&#39;s reasonable to assume that because we have more components than ever before, developers have started to notice how much more consistent their work is when they use MUI.</li>\n<li>Ease of use (no change): Could it be because ease of use is mostly defined by the React API (hooks), or is it because we haven&#39;t made any major API changes to optimize for ease of use? There could be a lot of work here for our new Developer Experience team.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And what has decreased:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Design (x0.75):</strong> Material Design hasn&#39;t evolved with changing tastes, and our work on a second design system to address this hasn&#39;t progressed as quickly we anticipated.<ul>\n<li>Material Design (x0.4): Its selling power is clearly fading.</li>\n<li>Look &amp; feel (x1.17): This is surprising.\nIt seems to be a transfer effect: people who previously cared more about Material Design now care more about the outcome than the specification itself.<br/></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<details>\n  <summary>Click to see the breakdown of categories.</summary>\n\n<table>\n  <tr><th style="width: 40px;">597</th><th style="width: 700px;">time</th><tr>\n  <tr><th>407</th><th>design</th><tr>\n  <tr><td>148</td><td>design - look & feel</td><tr>\n  <tr><td>122</td><td>design - look & feel+</td><tr>\n  <tr><td>73</td><td>design - consistency</td><tr>\n  <tr><td>73</td><td>design - Material Design</td><tr>\n  <tr><td>6</td><td>design - ?</td><tr>\n  <tr><td>4</td><td>design - easy</td><tr>\n  <tr><td>2</td><td>design - responsiveness</td><tr>\n  <tr><td>1</td><td>design - time</td><tr>\n  <tr><th>309</th><th>components</th><tr>\n  <tr><td>173</td><td>components - quantity</td><tr>\n  <tr><td>124</td><td>components - quality</td><tr>\n  <tr><td>5</td><td>components - advanced</td><tr>\n  <tr><td>3</td><td>components - data grid</td><tr>\n  <tr><td>2</td><td>components - ?</td><tr>\n  <tr><td>1</td><td>components - autocomplete</td><tr>\n  <tr><td>1</td><td>components - base/unstyled</td><tr>\n  <tr><th>306</th><th>DX</th><tr>\n  <tr><td>221</td><td>DX - easy to use</td><tr>\n  <tr><td>49</td><td>DX - consistency</td><tr>\n  <tr><td>32</td><td>DX - API</td><tr>\n  <tr><td>4</td><td>DX - ?</td><tr>\n  <tr><th>181</th><th>customizability</th><tr>\n  <tr><th>57</th><th>docs</th><tr>\n  <tr><td>39</td><td>docs - ?</td><tr>\n  <tr><td>17</td><td>docs - quality</td><tr>\n  <tr><td>1</td><td>docs - quantity</td><tr>\n  <tr><th>26</th><th>community</th><tr>\n  <tr><th>24</th><th>accessibility</th><tr>\n  <tr><th>17</th><th>performance</th><tr>\n  <tr><td>15</td><td>performance - runtime</td><tr>\n  <tr><td>1</td><td>performance - bundle size</td><tr>\n  <tr><td>1</td><td>performance - ?</td><tr>\n  <tr><th>9</th><th>community support</th><tr>\n  <tr><th>5</th><th>icons</th><tr>\n  <tr><th>3</th><th>typescript</th><tr>\n  <tr><th>2</th><th>animations</th><tr>\n</table>\n</details>\n\n<h3 id="please-rate-how-much-you-agree-or-disagree-with-the-following-statements">Please rate how much you agree or disagree with the following statements<a aria-labelledby="please-rate-how-much-you-agree-or-disagree-with-the-following-statements" class="anchor-link" href="#please-rate-how-much-you-agree-or-disagree-with-the-following-statements" tabindex="-1"><svg><use xlink:href="#anchor-link-icon" /></svg></a><button title="Post a comment" class="comment-link" data-feedback-hash="please-rate-how-much-you-agree-or-disagree-with-the-following-statements"><svg><use xlink:href="#comment-link-icon" /></svg></button></h3><img src="/static/blog/2021-developer-survey-results/4.png" style="width: 796px; margin-top: 16px; margin-bottom: 8px;" alt="I can find most of the components I need (Strongly agree: 45.5%, Agree: 45.9%, Neutral: 6.2%, Disagree: 1.5%, Strongly Disagree 0.8%); I can easily customize the components to match the desired design (Strongly agree: 23.4%, Agree: 46.1%, Neutral: 18.6%, Disagree: 9%, Strongly Disagree 2.9%); I can find the answers to most of my questions in the documentation (Strongly agree: 24.1%, Agree: 50.1%, Neutral: 16.3%, Disagree: 7.6%, Strongly Disagree 1.9%); I find the library\'s performance to be great (Strongly agree: 26.4%, Agree: 44.3%, Neutral: 22.6%, Disagree: 4.7%, Strongly Disagree 2%); Whenever I needed to get help, I received helpful responses, Stack Overflow or GitHub (Strongly agree: 20.9%, Agree: 36.7%, Neutral: 36%, Disagree: 4.6%, Strongly Disagree 1.8%)" />\n\n<p class="blog-description">1534\xa0out of 1589 answered.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s a good thing to have a general sense of agreement with most of the statements, however, there&#39;s a considerably big gap between &quot;Strongly agree&quot; and &quot;Agree&quot; for all but the first statement.
