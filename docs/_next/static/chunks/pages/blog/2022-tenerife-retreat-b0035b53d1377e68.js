the ocean floor, and 3,715m (12,188 ft) above sea level.</p>\n<p>With an average temperature ranging from about 18-25 \xb0C (68-77 \xb0F) year-round, it&#39;s hard to pick a bad time to

about what we hope to accomplish over the next several months on the way to our next major release: MUI v6.\nIt&#39;s still hard to say when that release day might come, but we&#39;re optimistic that

for non-technical roles such as <a href="/careers/people-operations-manager/">People Operations Manager</a> in which you could have a huge impact steering the direction of the company&#39;s nascent HR

the Northern Hemisphere, we can either:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>lean into the winter fun, maybe go skiing in the Alps? ⛷</li>\n<li>escape the cold by heading to some Equatorial beaches \uD83C\uDFDD</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you have a strong opinion one way or the other, then you better join the team sooner rather than later!</p>\n<p>I look forward to meeting new colleagues—as well as
